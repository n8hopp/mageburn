All the player has to do is run the executable - due to missing Publisher on both platforms, you need:
  - On Windows, when security prompt opens:
	- More Info button
	- Open Anyway
  - On MacOS, when you open the DMG file, you need to right click and click "Open". Then click "Open" again.

and then the Player can select the character they want. Once the character has been selected they will spawn in and the game starts! 

Nux Mode: In order to run Nux Mode, the player has to select the Nux Mode checkbox on the character select screen.
